      <description>The challenge is a contest, open to any student under the age of 24 who wants to explore and realise business ideas or simply connect with like minded people in the community.
Participants will be asked to form teams (must be 3 or more people) and to develop a new business idea using digital tools that are either beneficial to the community or represents a new business opportunity.

      <description>Why are we doing this?
We think this is a great opportunity for young people to bring their digital ideas to fruition and to learn how to start a successful business. It is also a great opportunity for local technical companies to engage with the next wave of digital talent in the region and together who knows the next Google could come out of the Kapiti region one day.

      <description>Thank you for considering to support your local community. To minimise impact on individual mentors we have devised 2 streams of mentoring.
Team Coach To be a team coach, you only have to want to spend time with participants and help them on their journey. Team coaches act as primary contact for participating teams. You will
 be available for a team to escalate questions to subject matter experts or the org team, so teams can address road blocks quickly.</description>
