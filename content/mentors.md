Thank you for considering to support your local community. To minimise impact on individual mentors we have devised 2 streams of mentoring.

#### Team Coach

To be a team coach, you only have to want to spend time with participants and help them on their journey. Team coaches act as primary contact for participating teams. You will

* be available for a team to escalate questions to subject matter experts or the org team, so teams can address road blocks quickly.
* monitor actions of your team inline with the Mentor Goals

There will be prep sessions prior to the challenge and forthnightly coach meetings alongside our workshops as per [schedule](/schedule).

#### Subject Matter Expert

If you have knowledge that you consider useful in context of this competition, but don't have that much time available registering as subject matter expert might be right for you. We would have your contact details on record and team coaches would facilitate potential face to face or online meetings once a clear problem statement exists, that you feel comfortable addressing.

However, if you want to spend more time, you're more than welcome to have an active role and i.e. participate in a workshop in your area of expertise as per [schedule](/schedule).

## Mentor Goals

The overarching goals of being a mentor are:

### Foster Basic Business Development Skills through:

* Guiding teams to focus their attention on building a strong foundation for a solid startup as per [LeanCanvas](https://s3.amazonaws.com/leanstack/v4/Lean-Canvas.pdf)
* Directing teams toward becoming experts in the applicable sphere of their potential business..

### Foster Critical Thinking through:

* Ensuring teams design and carry out effective experiments (most often customer interviews), ensure teams analyze the data they collect, and guide them in the right direction.
* Ensuring teams assume nothing. Ensure assumptions being made are identified and force teams to tackle those assumptions.

### Maintain the Flow through:

* Monitoring progress of your team and facilitate sessions to address blocking issues.
* Liaising between your team and subject matter experts to address open questions.


## Code of Conduct

To ensure fairness in the competition all mentors are required to sign a waiver safeguarding the IP of any team in the competition as well as accept a Code of Conduct to be discussed in [the first mentor workshop](/schedule/2017-05-23-mentor-workshop/) . To see what is further expected of mentors, head over to the Startup Weekend [Mentor Page](https://startupweekend.org/mentors) .
