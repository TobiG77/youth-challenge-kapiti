Why are we doing this?

We think this is a great opportunity for young people to bring their digital ideas to fruition and to learn how to start a successful business. It is also a great opportunity for local technical companies to engage with the next wave of digital talent in the region and together who knows the next Google could come out of the Kapiti region one day.
Who are the judges?
The three judges will be announced at the start of the challenge.
How will the challenge be judged?
The judges will give allocate points in the following areas:
• Uniqueness of the creation
• Social or commercial benefits
• Quality of the presentation
• Team work and collaboration
• Long term potential of the idea
Will there be any coaching?
Yes, local businesses will be providing support and mentoring for the teams. Experts in management, marketing, intellectual property and entrepreneurism will also be holding workshops during the challenge.
Who owns my idea?
Local mentors and supporters will be asked to sign a waiver that the intellectual property is owned by the team. Going forward if the idea is a good one you may consider trademarking, copywriting or patenting your idea. Coaching on intellectual property and how to protect it will be given during the challenge.
What happens after the challenge?
That’s up to the teams really, we’d love to see some of these ideas come to fruition but the important thing for us is to provide some insight to commercializing an idea and starting a digital company. We hope you learn a lot, have some fun and rest is up to you.
