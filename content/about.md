The challenge is a contest, open to any student under the age of 24 who wants to explore and realise business ideas or simply connect with like minded people in the community.

Participants will be asked to form teams (must be 3 or more people) and to develop a new business idea using digital tools that are either beneficial to the community or represents a new business opportunity.

During the project, each team will be mentored and invited to join workshops to help improve your understanding of starting a new business. Once the challenge closes, each team will be invited to pitch their idea to the Judging Panel, who will decide the ultimate winners.

While there are prices at the end, the biggest value are the experiences and connections made during the challenge.
